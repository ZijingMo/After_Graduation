# Introduction
*Based on most parts of React.JS's features, this is a long term project (ETA 4 mo. to 5 mo. from July 2019) to develop.*

Speaking of food, you might think of pizza, steak, burrito, salad, naan, kung pao chicken... Just as sashimi to Janpanese, schweinshaxe to German, burger is one of icons for the American food. When I traverse the mind: tag === "burger" => [{"McDonald": "Big Mac"}, {"Burger King": "Whopper"}, {"Arby's": "Smokehouse Brisket"}, {"Wendy's": "Dave's double"}, ... , {"Minnesota": "Juicy Lucy"}, ... , {"Tony Stark": "Cheeseburger"}]. Yea, this might be a thought from a burger fan :yum:

This project is regarding a burger builder system, based on one of most popular Javascript libraries: React.JS. Here is the To-do list for this application: Grilling-beef version (basic React.JS elements), Veggie-cheese version (adding Http/Ajax methods), Bread version (Redux), and Sesame version (authentication and CSS). This schedule is only a draft. Muti-editings will happen in the future.


To be continued!
