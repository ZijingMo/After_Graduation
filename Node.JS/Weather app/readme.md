# Brief Introduction
*This is the second of four applications. There are relations and differences among these four applications.*

*Programming lanauage: JavaScript. Runtime: Node.JS. Library: Express. Text editor: Visual Studio Code. Source code repository: [Redirect here](https://github.com/ZijingMo/Weather-website-nodeJS).*

## Features
Compared with her [elder sister](https://github.com/ZijingMo/After_Graduation/tree/master/Vanilla.JS/Weather), she focuses on the application of express library and coordinations between server and client side. This collection of pages contains four types of page: homepage, 'about' page, 'help' page, and '404' page. Weather and location queries are concentrated on homepage, which is called 'weather' page as well. Because of diverse choice of API, this application has stronger functionalities of weather forecast than her sis as below. 
1. Inputing same city's name from different countries, like London (US) and London (US).
2. Making a very specific address query, such as *1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW* (White House's address).
3. Scenic spot or historical site is valid input, like Buckingham Palace.
4. Multilingual typing is practicable and yet system can't guarantee accurate return value, for instance 皇居 (Japanese Imperial Palace, Tokyo), الرياض (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia)  
5. American zip code is effective as well. 

This application possesses other traits. Since this application is developed on Express library, it simplifies the process of HTTP methods for RESTful services. On the other hand, 'hbs' module runs the function of Handlebars.js. It is a kind of mustache templating lanuage. It keeps the view and the code separated. Instead of all web pages being static documents served up from 'public' directory, they are going to be handlebar-templates. Web developers are able to decide which parts are dynamic and which parts are static in the pages. This design of page could save a lot of time from repetitive operations.
